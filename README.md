- **Auto-Case** is a script wriiten in **C++** that converts your mistake into perfection.
- Or in simple terms it converts **LowerCase ‚Üî UpperCase**
- With the help of native **Windows** methods and of course the G.O.A.T **C++** anything is possible

## Built On üõ†
### C++
- **Auto-Case** works heavily with clipboard methods, most of the times there is no cross-platform way of doing this as diffrent OS provide diffrent way of interacting with its system components i.e (Clipboard component in here)
- **C++** works best for this kind of project , having target platform as **Windows** which provides **Win32** wrapper for **C++** making interaction with clipboard,   keyboard, windowState all easy to connect with **C++**
